# yquery
A simple Alfred workflow for Youdao API query (work with py3).

The similar workflow I used previously is no more working since it is developed based on an Alfred library which is neither working now due to Apple's removing python2.

**Prepare your translation instance on Youdao cloud yourself, and enter your application ID and key into the global variables before first use.**
